The program should be based on a textured cube spinning in 3D,  the position of the cube should be initially controlled by a timer driven rotation matrix, but could be user controlled in the final game specification.
The final details of the game implementation should be developed by the student, however it should be noted that no marks are allocated for game design so very little time should be spent on this aspect of the assignment. 
The program individual aspects that should be demonstrated are:
•	A DirectX shell displaying a smoothly rotating cube in 3D
	The cube should be loaded from an x.file and should be colored and textured. 
•	A sound file should be played and dynamically altered. The sound file should be loaded from a wav file and played at runtime. 
•	The spinning cube should be ported to the Game Cube console.  
•	The sound file should be modulated depending on the orientation of the cube.
Extra implementation required for distinction level:
	These basic features should be incorporated into a fully functioning PC game
