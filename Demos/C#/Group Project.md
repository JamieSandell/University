Project brief
Your project group represents a small software development company. You have
been asked by a local business to develop some software that they can use to
manage the workload of their staff. Managers will be able to create new tasks and
allocate them to staff, who will then be required to record time spent on each task and
progress towards completion. Managers will require regular reports of staff activities.
The software must be delivered to the customer at the end of the project fully tested
and ready to operate. A test plan, together with evidence that this testing has been
undertaken and passed will be required, as will proper user documentation.
Meeting the customer
Further information can be gathered by arranging a meeting with the company’s
representative. To arrange a meeting, nominate one of your group as the liaison with
the company, and then email your group’s customer to arrange a mutually convenient
time. Customer contact details are available on the module website. Be sure to quote
your group number in all correspondence. Make sure you record details of all
meetings with the customer so that you can submit them with your deliverables at the
end of the project.
Remember that your customers are busy people. Make sure you are properly
prepared before meeting them so that you do not waste your time or theirs.
Remember that most queries can easily be answered by email.
Project conduct
This project runs from week 6 to week 11. You will be expected to submit some
interim details at the end of week 7, and to give a short presentation and demonstrate
your finished software in week 11.
How you organise your group is up to you, but bear in mind that the timescale is short.
Work will have to be shared. Tasks will have to happen in parallel. A project plan
would be a good idea. You will be working in groups, so some project management is
essential. It may be wise to nominate one member of your group to be Project
Manager. Note that one of your deliverables is a report on the way in which the group
was organised and managed. You will be expected to give details of how tasks were
defined, distributed and undertaken.
