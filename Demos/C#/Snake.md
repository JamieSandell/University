The Snake Game
The player uses the keys to control the direction of movement of the head of the snake. The head
can move up, down, left or right. The body follows along after the head. The aim of the game is
to guide the head of the snake towards food items whilst avoiding the walls and the snake body
itself. The player is awarded points for the food that they eat and the length of time that they last
in the game.
If the snake head touches a wall or another part of the snake body the game is over.
As the game continues the snake body gets longer, making it harder to avoid crashing.
Food items appear on the playfield at random positions and for a limited time. If the player
manages to guide the snake head over the food a number of points are awarded for this.
Program Requirements
You are required to create a version of the Snake game which runs in the console window. This
provides a playfield made up of 25 rows of 80 characters. In order to achieve a pass mark on this
assessment your program must provide the following functions:
• The player must be able to steer the head of the snake around the screen using the
keyboard. The snake will move continuously in the direction chosen by the player. If
another direction is selected the snake movement must change to reflect this.
• If the snake head moves off the screen (i.e. the coordinates of the draw position are
beyond the playfield area) the game must display an appropriate message and stop.
• At random intervals a food item should appear on the screen. This will remain on the
screen for a random time. If the player manages to guide the snake head over the food
item the score for the player must be increased. The current score should be displayed on
the screen during the game. When the game finishes the final scores should be displayed
for the player before the program stops.
Program Enhancements
In addition to the minimal requirements, you can also enhance the program to add further
features:
• The head of the snake must be followed by a body which increases in length as the game
progresses. If the snake head collides with any part of the snake body the game is over.
• Appropriate sound and colour effects may be added to enhance the gameplay. You should
however not expend too much effort on this aspect of the game, as the work is being
assessed for programming, not artistic, ability.
• The game may implement a highest score table, which is displayed at the end of the game.
