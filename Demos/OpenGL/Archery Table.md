1. You are to produce a game that will consist of 2 players sliding coloured disks across a table to finish as close as possible to the centre of a target which is painted on the table.
2. The archery table has an overall size of 2550 mm long and 1300 mm wide (see figure 1). The table has a pale-green playing surface of 2500 mm long and 1200 mm wide (see figure 1). There are 3 sides to the table and these sides are brown in colour and are 50 mm wide and 50 mm high. There is a dark-green throwing line that runs across the bottom of the table that is 150 mm from the bottom of the table (see figure 1).
3. There is a target painted onto the table surface which consists of 3 circles. The centre of all 3 circles is a point at 600 mm away from the top and both sides of the table (see figure 1). The outer circle is coloured pink and is 800 mm in diameter. The middle circle is coloured white and is 500 mm in diameter. The inner circle is coloured orange and is 200 mm in diameter.
4. A player scores as follows: If the centre of a disk lies inside the orange circle, the player scores 500 points. Else, if the centre of a disk lies inside the white ring zone, the player scores 200 points. Else, if the centre of a disk lies inside the pink ring zone, the player scores 100 points.
5. Each player has 6 disks. Player 1 has red disks and Player 2 has blue disks. Initially the disks are placed at the bottom of the table and towards opposite sides of the table (see figure 1). Each playing disk is 50 mm in diameter, 10 mm in height, and weights 0.02 kg. The disks always move along the surface of the table and so they never leave the table top surface.
6. Each Player takes it in turn to throw one of their disks. This is done by firstly moving one of their disks left and right just inside of the throwing line. Then the player selects the direction that the disk will travel (this is represented on the table as a white line). Then the player selects the power of the throw (this is represented by the length of the white direction line).
7. Each players score should be displayed at the top of the screen. The current player’s throwing power should also be displayed at the top of the screen.
8. The user controls for the throwing of the disk via the keyboard are as follows: The ‘N/M’ keys move the current playing disk left and right respectively. The ‘left/right’ cursor keys rotate the current throwing angle left and right respectively. The ‘up/down’ cursors keys increases and decreases respectively the power of the throw. The ‘space’ key throws the disk in the same direction as the throwing angle line is facing at the velocity determined by the power of the throw.
9. You are to implement a simple Maths library. The Maths library is to be used in the Table Archery game when appropriate. The Maths Library will comprise at least the classes Vector3d, and Matrix33d. The classes require the following functionality Vector3d – addition, subtraction, scaling, dot product, cross product, normalization, and transformation by a 3x3 matrix. Matrix33d – addition, subtraction, scaling, multiplication, multiply a 3D vector
10. A physical based model is to be implemented as follows: Variable coefficient of friction between the table top surface and each disk (controlled by the ‘Q/A’ keys). Variable coefficient of friction between the table sides and each disk (controlled by the ‘W/S’ keys). Disk to disk impact is perfectly elastic (where the coefficient of elasticity = 1.0 and the disks have a coefficient of friction = 0 between them). Disk to sides of the table impact (where the variable coefficient of elasticity is between 0.1 and 1.0 and is controlled by the ‘E/D’ keys).
11. There are to be three views implemented, namely a plan view which looks directly down onto the centre of the table, a player view which is positioned just above the disk and looks along the throwing line, and an audience view which is a static camera that is positioned to one side of the table that follows the current playing disk. Use the ‘C’ key to switch from one view to another.
12. Three evenly spaced spot light sources should be installed 2000mm directly above the table, each with a direction normal facing the table and a spotlight cut-off angle should be chosen to enhance the visualization. The global ambient light should be set to an appropriate level to enhance the visualization.
13. To achieve extra credits, you should also consider the following issues: Apply textures to objects. Shadows of the disks. Implement the option of having obstructive cylinders positioned on the table.
