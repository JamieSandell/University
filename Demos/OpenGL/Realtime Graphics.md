2.0 Aim
The aim of this coursework is to produce a graphics demonstration programme written in C++. The demo programme will use GXBase and OpenGL and demonstrate a number of the algorithms and techniques developed within the modules 08960 and 08961. The final programme will have a number of modes of operation driven both from a script file and through user interaction.
3.0 Concept Design
The visual effects within this demo programme will be restricted to occur within a box that has, at any instant, three transparent sides. Various objects will be animated within the box and visualised via either a pre-determined script or through discrete key input from the user.
1) The box will be situated in the centre of the screen. In its 3D space, the Z axis will be vertical with the X and Y axes being horizontal. The box will have 8 spotlights situated at the corners pointing initially towards the centre of the box. Rotation of the box around the Z axis will be controlled either from a pre-defined script (identifying its angular velocity), or through keyboard input (left arrow = rotate clockwise, right arrow = rotate anti-clockwise). The faces with their outer side pointing towards the viewer should be made semi-transparent (allowing the viewing of objects within).
2) The colour, intensity and field of view of each of the eight spotlights should be definable in the script file. Lights should also be animated, being able to point at a particular object and follow it around the room. Optionally, the light colour and intensity should also change over time. Physically, the spotlights should be represented graphically by a small cone whose orientation changes as the spotlight follows an object.
3) One or more objects should be animated in the scene. Objects must include: sphere, platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron), glow ball, particle ball, null object. The size and material characteristics of each object should be included in the script file, along with a description of an animation path. In the case of the platonic solids, the object itself should be loaded from an object file. This file should contain sufficient information to describe the geometry of the object, the related normals, and texture coordinates. In the materials description for an object, an option should be included for texturing and therefore one or more filenames should be included for the textures used.
4) The glow ball is a special object that has 6 regularly spaced colour spotlights evenly distributed over a spherical surface. When this object is in a scene, the 8 spotlights at the corners of the box should be automatically turned off. Like other objects, the glow ball should be able to follow an animation path, illuminating all other objects in the box.
5) The particle ball is similar to the glow ball except that each of the 6 lights is replaced with a particle emitter. Your particle systems should be able to support at least two types of particle, points and textured quads. Particles will be emitted from the surface of the sphere and either fade out or impact onto the sides of the box. On impact they should leave a scorch mark – this should also fade out over time. You may include a number of parameters with each particle system but these should include: type (e.g. point or quad), material/texture, rate of generation, lifetime and scorch texture.
6) The null object has no geometry and is therefore invisible. It is included as an invisible object for lights sources to point at rather than a real object.
7) Animations paths should be definable for each object and included in the script file. Your code should at least support animation paths based on the trigonometric ‘sin’ function. In this case the (x,y,z) position of the object should be determined by a function of the form (Ax*sin(Bx*t+Cx)+Dx, Ay*sin(By*t+Cy) +Dy, Az*sin(Bz*t+Cz)+Dz) where t relates to time and Ai, Bi, Ci, Di are constant values (i=x,y,z). You should include a key press that starts and stops animation. You should also allow objects to tumble, however, the definition of this as an animation is left to you to decide.
8) Your program should support multiple animated objects in a single scene. Collision detection and collision response between objects is not required.
9) Visualisation of the scene will depend on the current mode selected. Options must include: wireframe, flat shaded, smooth shaded (Gouraud and Phong), smooth shaded textured. Smooth shading using the Phong model should be programmed using GLSL code and need only apply to spheres, cubes and platonic solids. No texturing effects are required from your GLSL code.
10) Special Effects.
a) Shadows. A simple implementation will allow shadows from objects to appear on the walls of the cube. However, a more complex implementation should allow shadows to appear on all objects.
b) Fog. A fog effect should be implemented in the box. This should include a representation of the light beams being partially visible as they go through the box.
c) Bloom. A bloom effect should be implemented around all lights within the box.
11) Your final program should support loading of your script file by name. You will need different script files to demonstrate various effects – you will be notified later what these are. Different modes of visualisation should also be switchable by pressing the ‘M’ key. This should cycle through wireframe, flat shading etc. By pressing ‘N’ the display of normals should also be available to the user. Pressing ‘A’ should start and pause the animation, allowing for closer inspection of the scene. ‘S’ should toggle between no-shadows, wall-shadows and full-shadows. The script file should allow for the definition of a rotation speed for the box (and all the contents). ‘P’ should toggle this animation on and off. When off, rotation of the box should be through use of the left and right arrow keys.
12) Keep a log of what you do each week, including what worked and what didn’t. You will be required to write a short report on your work at the end of the semester.
