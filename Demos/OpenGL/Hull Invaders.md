The Goodie Ship
• A single ‘shooter’ (a triangle) is positioned at the bottom of the screen.
• The shooter may be moved right and left using the cursor keys.
• The shooter may fire a bullet upwards towards the invader (User fires with SPACEBAR).
• The player has to wait until the bullet has gone off the screen or has hit an invader before
firing another bullet.
• The player has three shooters or ‘lives’.
The Invader
• The invader (a rectangle) starts at the top left hand corner of the screen and works its way to
the right of the window. When it reaches the limit of the window, it drops down (towards
the goodie shooter) and then moves to the left, when it reaches the left hand limit of the
window it drops down again and moves to the right etc. This continues until,
• The invader reaches the bottom of the screen or collides with the goodie shooter, then the
user loses a life (one of three that the player started with).
• The invader may drop bombs randomly (only one is visible on the screen at any one time)
which will destroy the goodie ship on contact (decrementing the number of lives).
• If the invader is hit by the goodie shooter’s bullet, the invader disappears, the players score
is incremented and the invader is returned to the top of the screen (this time moving slightly
faster than before).
Other Elements
• The game ends if the user’s number of lives is reduced to zero.
• The view must include the number of lives left and the player’s current score.
• Display your surname in the top left hand corner of the application’s window.
