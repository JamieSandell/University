The aim of the assignment is to provide you with opportunities to take advantage of modern
programmable GPUs to design and implement graphics effects used in a battlefield computer game.
You are required to write various battlefield effects as a set of shaders in HLSL and display them in
RenderMonkeyâ„¢ Toolsuite. All these effects should be implemented as different passes under a
single effect group. The key characters involved in the battle will be teapot-like robots with different
appearances and behaviours.
1. Basic Effects
The basic effects may include, but are not limited to:
a. Sky using the cube mapping technique; (5%)
b. Bump mapped terrain; (5%)
c. Animated lake water, which can be done in either per-vertex or per-pixel manner;
(5%)
d. Various kind of deformed and animated teapots:
1) Burning eroded teapot; (5%)
2) Flying jet-like teapot; (5%)
3) Robot-like teapot; (5%)
4) Tank-like teapot; (5%)
e. Fire, smoke, and explosions rendered with either particle systems or texture-based
animation techniques; (20%)
f. Animated flags; (5%)
2. Optional Effects (35%)
To achieve first class marks, the following effects may need to be considered
a. Interesting deformed and animated teapots of your own;
b. Animated tongues of fire jetted from the tail of the flying teapot-jet and missiles;
c. Synchronized behaviors between flying missiles and explosions;
d. Some ray traced shiny and transparent glass balls floating on the water surface;
e. Any other novel effects you would like to add to increase the realism of the battle
field.
3. Geometric models and textures
The geometric models and textures provided in RenderMonkey Toolsuite and DirectX SDK
are sufficient for the coursework. However, you are allowed to use geometric models and
textures created by yourself or obtained from the internet, but this is not encouraged in the
early stages of doing the coursework.
