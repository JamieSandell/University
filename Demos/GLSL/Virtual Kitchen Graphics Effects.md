The aim of the assignment is to provide you with opportunities to take advantage of modern
programmable GPUs to design and implement graphics effects used in a TV advert for selling
kitchen facilities. You are required to write these effects as a set of shader programmes in
GLSL and display them using RenderMonkeyâ„¢ Toolsuite.
1. Basic Effects
The effects may include, but are not limited to:
a. Texture mapped kitchen environment. (10%)
b. Shiny teapot rendered using cube mapping technique, which reflects the
kitchen environment. (10%)
c. Bumpy brick walls around the cooker rendered with bump mapping or Parallax
mapping techniques (10%)
d. Animated cooker fire and steam emitted from the rim of teapot. These effects
can be rendered using particle systems technique. (15%)
e. Some spot light sources used to illuminate the kitchen. These light sources
can either be implemented using either a per-vertex or a per-pixel approach.
(10%)
f. Some kitchen facilities, such as cooker and kitchen cabinets. (10%)
2. Optional Effects
To achieve first class marks, the following effects may need to be considered
a. Animated teapot lid motion due to steam escaping. (10%)
b. Animated water in the kitchen sink. (10%)
c. Any novel effects attempted. (10%)
3. Geometric models and textures
The geometric models and textures used in the program can be obtained from some
known graphics software or APIs, such as those in the media directories of the
RenderMonkey Toolsuite, the DirectX SDK, the NVDIA SDK. You can also download
the geometric models and textures required in your effects from the internet. In addition,
you can design and produce your own geometric shapes using certain graphics
software such as Maya and 3D studio Max. Any external models/textures used in the
assessment should be referenced in the report.
