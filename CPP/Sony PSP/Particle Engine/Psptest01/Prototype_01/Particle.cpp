	// Now we can move the particle. The math below may look strange, but once again, it's pretty simple. 
	// First we take the current particle x position. Then we add the x movement value to the particle 
	// divided by slowdown times 1000. So if our particle was in the center of the screen on the x axis 
	// (0), our movement variable (xi) for the x axis was +10 (moving us to the right) and slowdown was 
	// equal to 1, we would be moving to the right by 10/(1*1000), or 0.01f. If we increase the slowdown to
	// 2 we'll only be moving at 0.005f. Hopefully that helps you understand how slowdown works. That's 
	// also why multiplying the start values by 10.0f made the pixels move alot faster, creating an 
	// explosion. We use the same formula for the y and z axis to move the particle around on the screen.

	//Smaller the slowdown variable is the faster the particles move
	_position.SetVectorX(_position.X()+_speed.X()/(1.0*1000)); // Change 1 to slowdown variable, Move On The X Axis By X Speed
	_position.SetVectorY(_position.Y()+_speed.Y()/(1.0*1000)); // Change 1 to slowdown variable, Move On The Y Axis By Y Speed
	_position.SetVectorZ(_position.Z()+_speed.Z()/(1.0*1000)); // Change 1 to slowdown variable, Move On The Z Axis By Z Speed

	/*
		After we've calculated where to move the particle to next, we have to apply gravity or resistance. 
		In the first line below, we do this by adding our resistance (xg) to the speed we are moving at 
		(xi). Lets say our moving speed was 10 and our resistance was 1. Each time our particle was drawn 
		resistance would act on it. So the second time it was drawn, resistance would act, and our moving 
		speed would drop from 10 to 9. This causes the particle to slow down a bit. The third time the 
		particle is drawn, resistance would act again, and our moving speed would drop to 8. If the 
		particle burns for more than 10 redraws, it will eventually end up moving the opposite direction 
		because the moving speed would become a negative value. The resistance is applied to the y and z 
		moving speed the same way it's applied to the x moving speed.
